*RESTful API exposing TFL data on London underground status in a slack-friendly fashion*

It all started from:

- we need a pet project to work on where we can use Golang
- Slack is cool and it would be nice to integrate with it

And in a few days myself and [Oliver Sk√•nberg](https://twitter.com/oskanberg) ended up creating this small Slack integration (still evolving) which is temporarily being served from a nano EC2 instance for cost saving reasons. I tried with a Kubernetes cluster on Google Cloud but for few requests per month it felt like it was a bit overkilling.
The concept is simple, you ask for the tube status, and the service will reply with a nice Slack-friendly message.

This is what it looks like:

Once added the integration as **slash command** con Slack, you can call from any channel or chat the `/tube [tubeLine]` command (where the `tubeLine` is optional).
To add the integration, you need to push your **slack token** to this endpoint:
```json
    PUT https://thoeni.io/api/slack/token/{yourToken}
```

And the endpoint to configure as target for the **slash command** is:
```json
    PUT https://thoeni.io/api/slack/tubestatus
```
