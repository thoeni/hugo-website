**Technology** and **innovation** have always been the reason behind any choice
I've made throughout my life so far, including the recent - well, 2015! -
decision of moving to **London**.

After doing **Java** for a few years, and **Scala** for a couple of years mostly
to expand my knowledge of the functional programming paradigm, I finally managed
to work on a daily basis with what currently is my favourite programming
language, **[Go](http://golang.org)**.

In August 2017 I joined the [Go London User
Group](https://www.meetup.com/go-london-user-group/) organisers and we run the
meetup on a monthly basis: it's been a great experience so far, and it's very
interesting to see what goes on behind the scenes, and how much work is involved
in organising just a single event!

I've been using **[Docker](http://docker.io)** for a few years, I'm familiar
with AWS, and I spin up Lambdas whenever I feel the urge to teach something new
to Alexa.

This website has been built with **[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)**, and is being
served through Amazon S3/Cloudfront (following this very well made - but for a
couple of details -
[how-to](https://lustforge.com/2016/02/27/hosting-hugo-on-aws/)).
 
Apart from coding, I enjoy *reading* very much (often Psychology or Sci-Fi
books), as well as *cooking* and walking through some of the many beautiful
London parks.
