**Technology** and **innovation** have always been the reason behind any choice I've made throughout my life so far, including the recent - well, 2015! - decision of moving to **[London](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/London/@51.5285582,-0.24168,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x47d8a00baf21de75:0x52963a5addd52a99)**.

Following the last few years spent as a backend developer - mainly focusing on **Java** - and in the professional services working on transformation and integration projects, I've decided to get myself into functional programming starting with **Scala**. I've been working with Scala (and Play! Framework) on a daily basis for a year now, and using **[Go](http://golang.org)** for my side projects, as I find this language fascinating and *"essential"*: I use coding in Go as a meditation technique üôè.

I've been using **[Docker](http://docker.io)** for the last couple of years and I firmly believe in the philosophy that states *"You build it, you own it!"*: a good software engineer should take care of the product he/she builds, from inception, to support, through development.
I'm and enthusiastic TDD practitioner, though I'm not dogmatic and I really enjoy discussing about different testing approaches.

This website has been built with **[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)**, and is being served through Amazon S3/Cloudfront (following this very well made - but for a couple of details - [how-to](https://lustforge.com/2016/02/27/hosting-hugo-on-aws/)).
 
Apart from coding, I enjoy *reading* very much (often Psychology or Sci-Fi books), as well as *cooking* and walking through some of the many beautiful London parks.
