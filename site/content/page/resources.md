Eager conferences and meet-ups _**goer**_, I believe that every developer should nurture his/her passion as much as he/she can.
Meet-ups and conferences are a great way of doing it, and books, tutorials, articles... these days we have so many resources available that a lifetime wouldn't be enough in order to explore all of them!

So, here's me **to the rescue**, I'll share resources I find useful, those being events, books or anything in between.

### Conferences
I enjoy conferences a lot, it's a great opportunity to open your mind and look at things from a completely different perspective. I especially enjoy the feeling of coming back home full of ideas and inspiration for my - current or - next projects! 

Here's my calendar up to date!

### Meet-ups
One of the advantages of being here in **London** is that there's at least one meet-up I'd like to attend every other day! In the last months I started helping [Alice Lloyd](https://twitter.com/scalarecruit) with [Scala Central](https://www.meetup.com/Scala-Central/), a regular meet-up organised once a month.

- [Scala Central](https://www.meetup.com/Scala-Central/)
- [London Scala User Group](https://www.meetup.com/london-scala/)
- [Go London User Group](https://www.meetup.com/go-london-user-group/)
- [AWS User Group UK](https://www.meetup.com/AWSUGUK/)
- [London Microservices User Group](https://www.meetup.com/London-Microservices-User-Group/)
- [London Software Craftsmanship Community](https://www.meetup.com/london-software-craftsmanship/)

### Blog posts/articles
Too many, I know. I'm not a regular reader of any specific blog, I just happen to see someone sharing a link and often finding it insightful... in which case I might want to share it here.

### Books
I often start reading multiple books simultaneously - I'm not proud of it, but sometimes I get over excited! - but I thought this would be worth sharing as well
